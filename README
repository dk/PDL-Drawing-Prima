PDL::Drawing::Prima
===================

A PDL interface to the Prima drawing commands.

Buried deep inside the wonderful, Perl-centric Prima toolkit is a set of
cross-platform C functions that handle all of the drawing operations. PDL's
strength is its threading engine, and this module provides a fully threaded
subset of Prima drawing functions. As such, this module provides a way to
quickly perform many drawing operations on Prima Widgets.

At the moment, the bindings are only for screen-drawn objects. I started
work on the Postscript drawing interface but did not get very far. That may
get more attention in the future, likely to satisfy the file-output demands
of PDL::Graphics::Prima.

For more information, see the documentation for PDL::Drawing::Prima.


INSTALLATION
============

There are a number of ways to install this module. The simplest is to
install it using CPAN:

	cpan PDL::Drawing::Prima

If you have your hands on the actual source code (or you "look"ed at this
module from the CPAN shell), you would do the following:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

There are almost no tests for this distribution at the moment. I would like
to build a number of tests by emulating the PDL behavior with Perl loops
and comparing the rasterized output, but I have not gotten that far yet.
If this project gets a bit of momentum behind it, I truly hope that the
test suite gets some much-needed attention.


DEPENDENCIES
============

The installation of this module depends on a working C compiler. It also
depends on the Perl Data Language and the Prima GUI toolkit. You can
install both of these using CPAN. If you manage to get those installed
without trouble, installng this module should work fine unless you are
working with the stock Debian package of Prima. That package was improperly
built and does not list the correct location of Prima's CORE directory. That
makes it impossible to link against apricot.h (Prima's main library). I may
be able to write a special exception into the Makefile.PL for this, but I
haven't gotten around to it yet.
