=head1 CPAN

You, gentle reader, are reading this documentation off of CPAN. I know this
because B<this> documentation does not show up in the final .pm files that are
installed on a user's computer. I have gone to great lengths to ensure that
the CPAN-visible documentation is up-to-date, but it may be incomplete in
certain circumstances since PDL autogenerates some of its documentation. If
you have any concerns regarding documentation skew, be sure to check the
documentation on your local machine.

looks, copy this synopsis and replace the code in the
C<Example code goes here> block with the example code.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides a number of PDL-threaded functions and bindings for use
with the Prima toolkit. Many of the functions are PDL bindings for the
standard Prima drawing functions. Others are useful functions for color
manipulation, or getting data into a form that PDL knows how to handle.
I generally divide the subroutines of this module into two categories:
B<methods> and B<functions>. The methods are subroutines that operate on a
Prima widget; the functions are subroutines that act on or return piddles.

Most of the methods given here are PDLified versions of the Prima drawing API
functions, which are documented under L<Prima::Drawable>. In general, where the
Prima API uses singular nouns, I here use plural nouns. A few of the methods
are only available in this module, mostly added to accomodate the needs of
L<PDL::Graphics::Prima>, the plotting library built on these bindings.

At the moment, only drawing on displayed widgets is supported. However, I
believe it is possible to revise these bindings with only a few
modifications to get them to work on any Prima::Drawable object. Hopefully
those revisions will happen soon.

=head1 COORDINATE ORIGIN

The Prima image coordinate origin is located in lower left corner, which is
where you would expect to find it when creating plots. However, it is different
from the way that many graphics libraries do their coordinates.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 piddle_of_patterns_for

If you want PDL to thread over line patterns, but you want to use the standard
Prima line patterns, you'll need to convert them line patterns to a piddle.
This works very simply like this:

 my $patterns = piddle_of_patterns_for(lp::Solid, lp::Dash);

This creates a piddle with the two patterns so that you could have PDL thread
over them.

You can also create your own line pattern piddles by hand. I recommend you use
byte array, since otherwise it will be converted to byte arrays for you.
The first element of a row in your byte array
specifies the number of pixels to be "on", the second specifies the number to be
"off", the third specifies the number to be "on" again, the fourth "off", the
fifth "on", etc. If that doesn't make sense, hopefull a couple of examples will
help clarify.

This example creates the equivalent of lp::Dash:

 my $dash_pattern = byte (9, 3);

This example creates a piddle with four line types: lp::Solid, lp::Dash,
lp::ShortDash, and lp::DashDot:
 
 my $patterns = byte q[ 1; 9 3; 3 3; 9 3 1 3];

and should be identical to

 my $patterns = piddle_of_patterns_for(
     lp::Solid, lp::Dash, lp::ShortDash, lp::DashDot);
 
When you create a byte piddle, all of the patterns must have the same number of
bytes in their specification. Of course, different patterns have different
lengths, so in that case simply pad the shorter specifications with zeroes.

=cut

# Builds a piddle of patterns with the appropriate sizes, etc.
sub piddle_of_patterns_for {
	# Make sure they're not being stupid:
	croak("You must supply at least one pattern to make a pattern piddle")
		if @_ == 0;

	# First get the longest pattern:
	my $length = 0;
	foreach(@_) {
		$length = length($_) if $length < length($_);
	}
	
	use PDL::NiceSlice;
	
	# Create the new byte array with the appropriate dimensions:
	my $to_return = zeroes(byte, $length, scalar(@_));
	$to_return .= $to_return->sequence;
	for (my $i = 0; $i < @_; $i++) {
		# Get a slice and update it:
		my $slice = $to_return(:,$i);
		substr ${$slice->get_dataref}, 0, length($_[$i]), $_[$i];
		
		# Make sure the modifications propogate back to the original:
		$slice->upd_data;
	}
	
	no PDL::NiceSlice;
	
	return $to_return;
}

=head2 piddle_of_handles_for

You can call a single drawing function on multiple widgets and have PDL
thread over the widgets for you. Why would anyone ever want to do that, you
ask? The only reason I can imagine is if somebody wanted to create a new
set of widget skins, in which case you'd want to call the same drawing
function on various widgets (with various parameters, obviously). Will this
ever happen in practice? Probably not, but if I can come up with a use case,
I'm sure somebody else can come up with a different use case, so I've
implemented it.

When you call C<piddle_of_handles_for>, you get back a PDL_LongLong piddle. The
values returned are the actual integer values used as the handles to the
widgets, i.e. they are pointers, which means you B<SHOULD NOT MODIFY THEM>
or you will almost certainly get a segmentation fault. I believe there is
a way to mark a piddle as read-only, but I'm not quite sure how to do that.

	foreach(@_) {
		croak("One or more of your widgets does not seem to be descended from Prima::Drawable")
			unless blessed($_) and $_->isa('Prima::Drawable');
	}
	
	# Make a piddle large enough to hold the handles:
	my $to_return = zeroes(longlong, scalar(@_));
	
	# put the handles in the piddle:
	_piddle_of_handles_for(${$to_return->get_dataref}, @_);
	
	# Update the piddle and return it:

=head1 METHODS

The methods described below are a bit unusual for PDL functions. First, they are
not actually PDL functions at all but are methods for C<Prima::Drawable>
objects. Second, their signatures will look a bit funny. Don't worry too much
about that, though, because they will resemble normal signatures close enough
that you should be able to understand them, I hope.

=for details
As far as I can tell, PDL::PP only defines the '_<func>_int' form of a function
when you specify a PMCode in the pp_def. I can't figure out where this happens
in PP.pm, but that appears to be the output behavior. For an introduction to
postscript, see http://local.wasp.uwa.edu.au/~pbourke/dataformats/postscript/
and http://www.physics.emory.edu/~weeks/graphics/howtops1.html

=head1 Complex parameter handling

Each of the functions in this module wrap a PDL function around the
Prima API. The goal of the PDL functions is to allow the caller to
provide as many or as few tweaks to their drawing as they wish, so if
they want to draw three different polylines with three different line
styles (as demonstrated in test.pl), they should be able to do this:

 $widget->pdl_polylines($xs, $ys, {linePatterns => $patterns});

and it will DWIM. That means that the PP functions have to (1) get all
the possible preferences in as parameters (preferably piddles), (2) the
PP functions have to call the appropriate functions from apricot.h
to do their work, and (3) the PP functions have to package their piddles
in a form that the apricot.h functions know how to handle. To make
matters even more complicated, different API functions pay attention to
different properties, so different ones apply for different functions!

To deal with all of this, the next 400 or so lines of code create some
machinery that greatly assists in building the pp_defs that follow. A
great deal of this code is used in THIS script (.pd files are actually
scripts that generate .xs and .pm files) to assist in generating code.
Anything that needs to end up in the *output* files will be quoted, so
hopefully your syntax highlighter will help you pick them apart.

# Creating the look-up table for the Pars section #
###################################################

=begin details

This hash translates from a simple parameter name to a PDL signature.
Without this hash, if I wanted to write a function that allows the user
to draw lines with different colors, I would write the following Pars:

  Pars => 'int x(n); int y(n); int colors()'

So in the hash below, the property C<colors> is associated with the
arg string C<int colors()>, and (not-optional, but specially processed)
C<handles> property is associated with the arg string C<longlong handles()>.
(longlong is necessary here so that the integer data type is large enough to
hold 64-bit pointer addresses.)

=end details

=cut

my %pars_args_for = (colors => 'int colors()'
	, handles => 'longlong handles()'
);

=begin details

At the moment, I only have the colors property. If you know the Prima
Drawable API, you'll know I'm missing a lot! This is because I will
build up a number of structures over this discourse and I would
like to keep the code and specifications for each property in one place.
Scroll down to the 'Assembling machinery' portion of this code, about
175 lines below, and you'll see all the parts for each of the Drawable
properties defined in one place.

# Generating Pars lists #
#########################

=begin details

This function creates a string with the low-level PDL function's argument
list, given a list of properties for the function. This makes it very
easy to manage long parameter lists, and long parameter lists are nicely
handled by the in-pm function C<get_sorted_args_with_defaults>. It also
adds handles to the signature, which is mandatory for each of these
functions. To expand on the previous example, in this code:

 pp_def('my_func',
        Pars => 'int x(n); int y(n); ' . generate_pars_args_for( 'colors', 'rops'),
        ...
 );

pp_def sees a parameter list that looks like this:

 'int x(n); int y(n); longlong handles(); int colors(); int rops()'

To use this, I will create a list of properties that the to-be-defined
function takes, and use that together with generate_pars_args_for like
so:

 my @clear_properties = qw(backColors rop2s);
 pp_def('prima_clear',
        Pars => 'int x1(); int y1(); int x2(); int y2(); '
                 . generate_pars_args_for(@clear_properites),
        PMCode => ...
 );

It may seem silly to use such an array for only two additional arguments
(as shown in this example), but other parts of the pp_def call will make
use of that array, as we will see, and most of the functions use many
more properties.

=end details

=cut

sub generate_pars_args_for {
	foreach (@_) {
		croak("Bad args; should be plural") unless /s$/;
	}
	return join('; ', @pars_args_for{'handles', @_});
}

######################################
# Property-dependent local variables #
######################################

=begin details

As already mentioned, many of the properties that could potentially be
sent to the drawing apricot.h functions will need a set of local
variables. Currently, clipRects and linePatterns need special variables
to do their work, and these variables should be created outside the
threadloop. (regions, when implemented, may need to use this, too.)
Functions that do not care about those properties will not need those
variables, so they should only be included in functions that actually
use them. generate_init_args_for handles this code generation, taking
the same array of properties used by generate_pars_args_for. See the
next section for an example of use.

Note that entries in C<%init_args_for> should be semi-colon seperated,
since they are C declarations, but the last entry should not have a 
semi-colon. One will be appended. This is to keep consistency with
C<%pars_args_for>, which has the same format.

=end details

	foreach(@_) {

# Tracking which properties need setting #
##########################################

=begin details

The only way to determine from within PP code whether an optional parameter
was passed in or not is to pass an additional structure to the PP code with
that information. The structure I use for this is the original hash passed
in as an argument to the Perl-level function. If the user specified a value
for a property, it will be present in the hash. If they did not, it will not
be there.

So, for each of the graphics properties that the user can supply for a given
function, I will want to have code in the PP Code section that looks
something like this:

 int is_setting_rops;
 is_setting_rop = hv_exists(arg_hash_hv, "rops", 4);

This code checks if the key "rops" exists in the arg_hash_hv hash (which
must be passed in to the PP function via OtherPars). The
return value is a boolean, which I will use in the threadloop. Looking
up these values once and storing their results will make the resulting
code much less cluttered, and hopefully faster.

Here's a function that generates the code for me, based on the supplied
list of properties. It's a little different from the example above, but
they basically do the same thing. It, too, uses the same array of
properties used by generate_pars_args_for. The auto-generated code from
this function is inserted directly into the Code key in the pp_def
function call, like so:

 my @func_pars = qw(backColor linePattern);
 pp_def('my_func',
     Pars => 'int arg1(n); ' . generate_pars_args_for(@func_pars),
     ...
     Code => q{
         /* set-up variables I will need throughout the threadloop */
         int alpha;
     } . generate_init_args_for(@func_pars)
       . create_boolean_setters_for(@func_pars)
     . q{
         alpha = -1;
         ... 
         threadloop %{
             ...
         %}
     },

sub create_boolean_setters_for {
	# Make sure I handle an empty list correctly. I can't imagine
	# calling this function with an empty list, but let's be safe:

# Creating the initialization code #
####################################

=begin details

I've built up a lot of machinery to handle the various required arguments
and optional properties. This next chunk of code gives a single function
that will call everything in the proper order to declare and initialize
the necessary variables, early within the Code section.

my $default_other_pars = 'SV * arg_ref_sv';

#######################
# Calling the setters #
#######################

=begin details

Each of the setters needs to first check if its call is even necessary
(using the boolean variables set-up in the previous section),
and then it needs to call the appropriate setter from apricot.h. This is
easy but repetitive code, so once again I generate it from the same
list of arguments as everything else. In what follows, I create a
function that generates these code fragments for me, or looks them up
in a hash if they're complicated. Note that the function wraps the
looked-up code in its own curly-braced block; all you need to write is
the code itself like the following colors example shows:

The auto-generated code for this section is inserted directly into the
Code key in the pp_def function call, within the threadloop, before the
apricot function for this function is itself called. For example:

 q[
     ...
     threadloop %{
		 /* Apply any per-threadloop tweaks */
         ] . generate_setter_code_for(@func_pars)
         . q[
         /* Call the apricot function */
         my->set_func(args);
     %}
 ]

},
);

sub generate_single_setter_code_for {
	my $property = shift;
	# Make the singular name from the plural:
	(my $singular = $property) =~ s/s$//;
#	# apricot uses underscores and all lowercase instead of CamelCase:

	# Build the return string:

	if (exists $set_code_for{$property}) {
		# Insert special handling code:
		$to_return .= $set_code_for{$property};
	}
	else {
		# Most other properties are direct sets:
		$to_return .= "\t\t\t\tmy->set_$singular(widget_handle, \$$property());\n";
	}
	
	$to_return .= "\t\t\t}";

# Argument processing, ordering, and default handling #
#######################################################

=begin details

Each of the perl-side functions that gets invoked as an object
method checks its arguments. It does this by analyzing the hash sent in
by the caller, checking for properties that don't belong, or were
mis-spelled, and repackaging the results into a list with the exact
order needed by the PP code. Most parameters take a single piddle as
their argument, but some don't. This code needs to know how many
arguments go with each parameter, so it can check that, too. Such a list
of parameters can be automatically constructed from the already-defined
%pars_args_for hash.

=end details

pp_addpm (join("\n"

=begin details

Having collected the number of arguments associated with each of the
properties, I need a function to actually process the hash.
This is a function that I call in all of my PMCode sections. It takes an
anonymous list of names and an anonymous hash. If the hash has a key for
one of the names, it includes that in the return list. If it doesn't, it
returns the default value of a 0-dim piddle with a value corresponding to
the widget's handle. If one of the hash keys is not in the list of names,
it croaks.

Put a little differently, this function takes an anonymous hash, makes
sure there are no extraneous arguments, extracts the desired arguments
or uses a sensible default, and returns the arguments in the desired
order.

The PMCode section of each of these is pretty much the same. This

This code is very dense. I hope that it is documented well enough with
comments that any future maintainer will be able to understand it. If
in doubt, this function operates stand-alone, so you can copy it into
a little test script and try calling it with sample parameters to get a
feel for how it behaves.

working here - I have a few argument checking
ideas for this function, including
considering checking that C<$self> is a Prima::Drawable type, but not
Prima::PS::Drawable. Also, I bet if PDL barfs, it'll point to the line
in the (generated) pm file, so the pdl function call should probably be
wrapped in an eval block, and $@ should be post-processed.

At last I begin the declaration of PP code. The idea behind all of this
machinary is that I declare a collection of applicable properties in
THIS SCRIPT, and then use that to generate consistent code blocks. I
even use the properties array to generate compile-time accurate
documentation, so the on-machine documentation can never go out-of-sync
with the on-machine library.

Draws arcs, i.e. incomplete ellipses.

The arcs go from the C<start_angle>s to the C<end_angle>s along the
ellipses centered at the C<x>s and C<y>s, with the specified x- and
y-diameters. The angles are measured in degrees, not radians.
The difference between this command and L</chords> or L</sectors> is that
C<arcs> does not connect the dangling ends.

Here's a simple example:

=for example

 # Draw a bunch of random arcs on $canvas:
 my $N_arcs = 20;
 my ($x_max, $y_max) = $canvas->size;
 my $xs = zeroes($N_arcs)->random * $x_max;
 my $ys = $xs->random * $y_max;
 my $dxs = $xs->random * $x_max / 4;
 my $dys = $xs->random * $y_max / 4;
 my $th_starts = $xs->random * 360;
 my $th_stops = $xs->random * 360;
 
 # Now that we've generated the data, call the command:
 $canvas->pdl_arcs($xs, $ys, $dxs
                , $dys, $th_starts, $th_stops);

If you put that snippet of code in the onPaint method, as
suggested in the synopsis, a completely new set of arcs will get
redrawn whenever you resize your window.

routines include L</pdl_chords> and L</pdl_sectors>. See also
L</pdl_fill_chords>, and L</pdl_fill_sectors>, L</pdl_ellipses>, and

Spline drawing provides a similar functionality, though more complex and
more powerful. There are no PDL bindings for the spline functions yet.

  Prima Signature: (widget; x(n); y(n); properties)

=for ref

Draws and fills a polygon with (mostly) arbitrary edge vertices.

NOTE: there is B<no> underscore between C<fill> and C<poly>, which is
different from the other C<fill> methods!

This is useful for drawing arbitrary filled shapes and for visualizing
integrals. Splines would be the better choice if you want to draw curves, but
a PDL interface to splines is not (yet) implemented.

Unlike most of the other methods, this one actually makes a half-hearted
effort to process bad values. In addition to the IEEE bad values of C<nan>
and C<inf>, PDL has support for bad values. Unlike in C<pdl_polys>,
C<pdl_fillpolys> will simply skip any point that is marked as bad, but drawing
the rest of the polygon. In other words, it reduces the degree of your polygon
by one. If you sent it four points and one of them was bad, you would get a
triangle instead of a quadralaters.

Infinities are also handled, though not perfectly. There are a few
situations where C<pdl_polys> will correctly draw what you mean but
C<pdl_fillpolys> will not.

Because this skips bad data altogether, if you have too much bad data
(i.e. fewer than three good points), the routine will simply not draw
anything. I'm debating if this should croak, or at least give a warning.
(Of course, a warning to STDOUT is rather silly for a GUI toolkit.)

For example:

=for example

 # working here
 $canvas->pdl_fillpolys($x, $y);

  Prima Signature: (widget; x(); y(); x_diameter(); y_diameter();

=for ref

Draws an arc from C<start_angle> to C<end_angle> along the ellipse
centered at C<x>, C<y>, with specified x- and y-diameters. Like
L</fill_chords>, this command connects the end points of the arc, but
unlike L</fill_chords>, it does so by drawing two lines, both of which
also connect to the ellipse's center. This results in shapes that look
like pie pieces.

=for example

 # working here
 $canvas->pdl_fill_sectors($x, $y, $xd, $yd, $th1, $th2);

Compare to the Prima method L<Prima::Drawable/fill_sector>. The unfilled
equivalent is L</pdl_sectors>. This is closely related to C</pdl_fill_chords>
and C</pdl_fill_ellipses>. See also L</pdl_arcs>, L</pdl_chords>, and
L</pdl_ellipses>.

  Signature: (widget; x(); y(); N_points(); orientation(); filled(); size(); skip(); properties)

=for ref

Draws a wide variety of symbols centered at (x, y).

Through various combinations of C<N_points>, C<filled>, and C<skip>, you can
generate many different regular symbols, including dashes, stars, asterisks,
triangles, and diamonds. You can also specify each symbol's C<size> and
C<orientation>. The size is the radius of a circle that would circumscribe
the shape. The orientation is... well... just keep reading.

The shape drawn depends on C<N_points>. If C<N_points> is:

=over

=item zero or one

This will draw a circle with a radius of the
given size. The circle will be filled or not based on the value passed for
C<filled>, but the C<orientation> and C<skip> parameters are ignored. This
is almost redundant compared with the ellipse functions, except that this
arrangement makes it very easy to thead over filled/not-filled, and you
cannot specify an eccentricity for your points using C<pdl_symbols>.

=item two

This will draw a line centered at (x, y) and with a length of 2*C<size>.
The C<orientation> is measured in degrees, starting from horizontal, with
increasing angles rotating the line counter-clockwise. The value for C<skip>
is ignored.

This is particulary useful for visualizing slope-fields.

=item three or more

This will draw a shape related to a regular polygon with the specified
number of sides. Precisely what kind of polygon it draws is based on the
value of C<skip>. For example, a five-sided polygon with a C<skip> of one
would give you a pentagon:


                           second point
                               _
               third   __..--'' \
               point  |          \
                      |           \
                      |            \  first
                      |            /  point
                      |           /
                      |__        /
              fourth     ``--.._/
              point
                           fifth point

                           skip = 1

In contrast, a five-sided polygon with a skip of 2 will give you a star:

                           fourth point
                           
              second          /|                
              point   \`~.._/  |            
                       `\ / `--|.__          
                         X     | __>  first point       
                       ,/ \_,--|'                
              fifth   /_~'' \  |                 
              point           \|
                            
                           third point
 
                           skip = 2

A skip of three would give visually identical results but the actual order
in which the vertices are drawn is different:

                           third point
                           
              fifth           /|                
              point   \`~.._/  |            
                       `\ / `--|.__          
                         X     | __>  first point       
                       ,/ \_,--|'                
              second  /_~'' \  |                 
              point           \|
                            
                           fourth point
 
                           skip = 3

A skip of zero is a special case, and means I<draw lines to each point from
the center.> In other words, create an asterisk:

                           second point
                               
               third            /
               point   `.      / 
                         `.   /   
                           `./_______  first
                           .'\         point
                         .'   \
                       .'      \
              fourth            \
              point
                           fifth point
 
                           skip = 0

In summary, a C<skip> of zero gives you an N-asterisk. A C<skip> of one gives
you a regular polygon. A C<skip> of two gives you a star. And so forth.
Higher values of C<skip> are allowed; they simply add to the winding behavior.

Specifying the orientation changes the position of the first point and,
therefore, all subsequent points. A positive orientation rotates the first
point counter-clockwise by the specified number of degrees. Obviously, due
to the symmetry of the shapes, rotations of 360 / N_points look identical to
not performing any rotation.

For all nonzero values of C<skip>, specifying a fill will end up with
a filled shape instead of a line drawing.

=back

This example creates a table of shapes. It uses an argument from the command
line to determine the line width.

=for example

 use PDL::NiceSlice;
 
 # Generate a table of shapes:
 my @dims = (40, 1, 30);
 my $N_points = xvals(@dims)->clump(2) + 1;
 my $orientation = 0;
 my $filled = yvals(@dims)->clump(2) + 1;
 my $size = 10;
 my $skip = zvals(@dims)->clump(2);
 my $x = $N_points->xvals * 25 + 25;
 my $y = $N_points->yvals * 25 + 25;
 my $lineWidths = $ARGV[0] || 1;
 
 # Draw them:
 $canvas->pdl_symbols($x, $y, $N_points, 0, $filled, 10, $skip

Bad values are handled by C<pdl_symbols>. If any of the values you pass in
are bad, the symbol is not drawn at that x/y coordinate.

Converts an HSV color triple to an RGB color triple

HSV stands for hue-saturation-value and is nicely represented by a cirle in a
color palette. In this representation, the numbers representing saturation and
value must be between 0 and 1; anything less than zero or greater than 1 will be
truncated to the closest limit. The hue must be a value between 0 and 360, and
again it will be truncated to the corresponding limit if that is not the case.
For more information about HSV, see L<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV>.

Note that Prima's C<hsv2rgb> function, upon which this was based, had a special
notation for a hue of -1, which always corresponded to a saturation of 0. Since
a saturation of 0 means 'use greyscale', this function does not make any special
use of that notation.

The first dimension of the piddles holding the hsv and rgb values must be size
3, i.e. the dimensions must look like (3, m, n, ...). The resulting piddle is
suitable for input into L<rgb_to_color> as well as manual manipulation.

On the other hand, if you have data but you know that the dimensions of x and
y match, you could modify the above like so:

 my ($xmin, $xmax) = $x->where($x->isgood & $y->isgood)->minmax;
 my ($ymin, $ymax) = $y->where($x->isgood & $y->isgood)->minmax;

However, what if you have only one-dimensional x-data but two-dimensional
y-data? For example, you want to plot mutliple y datasets against the same
x-coordinates. In that case, if some of the x-data is bad, you could probably
hack something, but if some of the y-data is bad you you will have a hard time
picking out the good pairs, and getting the min/max from them. That is the
purpose of this function.

                   $max_to_collate(M); $max_index(M);
                   N_pixels; $p1(M); $p2(M); ...);

=for ref

Collates the min/max two piddles according to their supplied indices.

This function pretty much only makes sense in the context of
PDL::Graphics::Prima and it's auto-scaling calculations. Here's how it
works.

Suppose you're drawing a collection of colored blobs. Your blobs have
various radii and you want to know the min and the max x-positions, collated
for each radius. In other words, for all the blobs with radius 1, give me
the min and the max; for all the blobs with radius 2, give me the min and
the max; etc. However, you are not going to draw the blobs that have a 
badvalue for a the y position or the color---badvalues for any of these mean
"skip me". You only want to know the minima and maxima for the blobs that
you intend to draw. Also, let's assume that the widget onto which you intend
to draw is 500 pixels wide.

For that situation, you would call collate_min_max_wrt_many like so:

 my ($min, $max) = PDL::collate_min_max_wrt_many($x, $xRadii, $x, $xRadii
                                  , 500, $y, $yRadii, $colors);

The arguments are interpreted as follows. The first two piddles are the
values and the indices of the data from which we wish to draw the minima.
Here we want to find the smallest value of x, collated according to the
specified pixel radii. The next two piddles are the values and indices of
the data from which we wish to draw the maxima. The fifth argument, a scalar
number, indicates the maximum collation bin.

The remainder of the arguments are values against which we want to check
for bad values. For example, suppose the first (x, y) pair is (2, inf). This
point will not be drawn, because infinity cannot be drawn, so I will not
want to collate that x-value of 2, regardless of the xRadius with which it
corresponds. So, each value of x is included in the min/max collation only
if all the other piddles have good values at the same index.

This function threads over as many as 20 extra piddles, checking each
of them to see if they have bad values, inf, or nan. The limit to 20 piddles
is a hard but arbitrary limit. It could be increased if the need arose, but
the function would need to be recompiled.

=for bad

This function is explicitly meant to handle bad values. The output piddles
will have bad values for any index that was not represented in the
calculation. If any of the supplied piddles have bad values, the
corresponding position will not be analyzed.

=head1 ERROR MESSAGE

These functions may throw the following exception:

=head2 Your widget must be derived from Prima::Drawable

This means that you tried to draw on something that is not a Prima::Drawable
object, or a class derived from it. I don't know enough about the Prima
internals to know if that has any hope of working, but why do it in the first
place?

=head1 PDL::PP DETAILS

Those well versed in PDL::PP might ask how I manage to produce pdlified methods
that take variable numbers of arguments. That is a long story, and it is told in
the volumes of comments in pdlprima.pd. Give it a read if you want to know what
goes on behind the scenes.

=head1 TODO

These are all the things I wish to do:

=over

=item Full Drawabel API

I would like a PDL function for every drawable function in the API.
Prima Drawable functions that currently do not have an equivalent PDL
implementation include L<Prima::Drawable/draw_text>,
L<Prima::Drawable/fill_spline>, L<Prima::Drawable/put_image>,
L<Prima::Drawable/put_image_indirect>, L<Prima::Drawable/rect3d>,
L<Prima::Drawable/rect_focus>, L<Prima::Drawable/spline>,
L<Prima::Drawable/stretch_image>, and L<Prima::Drawable/text_out>

=item PS Functionality

Currently, this library only implements PDL functions using the apricot
library. Since L<Prima::PS::Drawable> implements its own drawing
functions, none of the PDL drawing functions will work with a PS drawable.
Either they need their own specially created functions that will emit postscript
code, or I need to find a way to find the Drawabel object's drawing functions
and call those from these bindings, instead of the direct drawing methods.

=item Bad Value Support

Bad values are handled decently in L</polylines> and L</fillpolys>, but not for
the other functions. Bad x/y values should be skipped for almost all the drawing
primitives, but what about bad colors for valid coordinates? One thought is to
default to the widget's default color, or to the value associated with the
singular key (i.e. C<color>), but I'm not sure if that's a good idea.

=item "Atomic" Operations

I would like to be able to specify colors, for example, and have the state of
the widget revert back to the original color after the drawing command has
finished. In other words, I would like the state of the widget after these
drawing commands to be the same that it was before these commands. This can be
implemented by having the drawing commands backup the widget's properties before
running, and restoring them afterwards.
