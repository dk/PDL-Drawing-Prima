Put changes under the appropriate header. Headers can include API CHANGES, 
DIFFERENT BEHAVIOR, BUG FIXES, DEPENDENCIES, ENHANCEMENTS, NEW FEATURES, and
OTHER. Entries should be in reverse chronological order, i.e. newest on top.

0.14 Feb 13, 2022

  [ENHANCEMENTS]
  
  * Now includes a real test! t/10 uses the Prima/Perl interface and the
    pdl interface to draw what should be identical things---lines of
    various colors. It then performs a pixel-by-pixel comparison to make
    sure you get the exact same result. Much more needs to be written
    but now at least I have the template.

  [DEPENDENCIES]
  
  * Bumped required verson of PDL to v2.037. Should have done this with the
    release of v0.13, but that was a bit hasty. Oops. This is the required
    minimum version mostly because some versions of PDL earlier than
    v2.037 made changes to PDL::PP that broke the compilation of this
    distribution. The changes to PDL::PP were fixed with v2.037.
  
  [BUG FIXES]
  
  * Fixed a minor bug that caused PDL::Drawing::Prima::Utils to not compile
    on some platforms. Should have used pp_line_numbers, but rolled my own
    in a few spots for some reason.

0.13 Feb 09, 2022

  [BUG FIXES]
  
  * Prima changed fillWinding to fillMode, which required a change to
    PDL::Drawing::Prima's interface. Thanks to dk for this fix!

  [DEPENDENCIES]
  
  * Bumped required verson of Prima to 1.57

0.12 Aug 01, 2016

  [BUG FIXES]
  
  * PDL::PP now requires a call to pp_done, which was missing in Utils

0.11 Nov 07, 2015

  [BUG FIXES]
  
  * Fixed backwards-compatible support code, which wasn't actually fully
    backwards compatible as written.
  
  * Update Build.PL to work with newest PDL.
  
  [DEVELOPMENT]
  
  * Added Travis support for github repository


0.10 Oct 28, 2013

  [ENHANCEMENTS]
  
  * Added backwards-compatible support for PDL v2.007.
  
  * Hacked an improved symbol drawing for crosses and triangles. It sometimes
    happened that the bottom leg of a cross symbol wasn't straight down due to
    rounding a floating-point number that is slightly less than the integer it
    was supposed to be. This hack makes it work slightly better, though an even
    better algorithm would be preferred.
  
  * Added a Changes file.
  
  * Revised PDL::Drawing::Prima::Utils::minmaxforpair() to use standard
    functions in math.h for determining whether a value is finite or not.
  
  [BUG FIXES]
  
  * Fixed corner-case in PDL::Drawing::Prima::Utils::hsv_to_rgb.



0.09 Jan 4, 2013

  [BUG FIXES]
  
  * Fixed Build.PL's linking; now should work on Cygin and Strawberry.



0.08 Sep 9, 2012

  [BUG FIXES]
  
  * Fixed Windows runtime link error.
  
  [DEPENDENCIES]
  
  * Bumped required verson of Prima to 1.35



0.07 Aug 6, 2012
  
  [API CHANGES]
  
  * Deprecated PDL::Drawing::Prima::pdl_of_handles_for()
  
  [DIFFERENT BEHAVIOR]
    
  * Drawing operations are now atomic!! Now, when you call pdl-based drawing
   function on a Prima drawable, the drawable's state will be restored to its
   original state before the function returns.
  
  [ENHANCEMENTS]
  
  * Documentation for the properties supported by a drawing operation are now
    guaranteed to be correct because they are extracted directly from the
    documentation.
  
  [DEPENDENCIES]
  
  * Added minimum version for Module::Build (0.28)
  
  * Bumped minimum version for PDL to 2.4.10
  
  * Added runtime Prima version check

  [NEW FEATURES]
  
  * Added fillPattern property to applicable drawing functions.
